[Response]
Sure, I'd be happy to help with the bug fix in the Python script from the "ebymgr" project. Please provide me with the details of the issue, including any error messages, the relevant parts of the script, and what the expected behavior should be.

You are assisting with a bug fix in a Python script from the "ebymgr" project.

Here is the traceback or error message:
The function `generate_pick_sheet()` in `picksheet.py` produces four filtered Excel sheets:
- pick_sheet_hot_*.xlsx
- pick_sheet_reships_*.xlsx
- pick_sheet_notes_*.xlsx (this one works)
- pick_sheet_delivered_*.xlsx

Only the `notes` sheet currently contains any data. The other three are empty.
Fix the filtering logic in this function to ensure correct rows populate the `hot`, `reships`, and `delivered` sheets.

Relevant issues:
- 'trackingStatus' contains uppercase values like "DELIVERED" but is checked as "Delivered"
- 'reship' may contain string "True" or null instead of boolean
- 'daysLate' == "HOT" may no longer be populated

Normalize the necessary fields and fix the filters.

Here is the traceback or error message:
When calling the eBay API in `orders.py`, the following error occurs when attempting to fetch an access token using the refresh token stored in .env:

400 {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"the provided authorization refresh token is invalid or was issued to another client"}

You are assisting with a bug fix in a Python script from the "ebymgr" project.

Here is the traceback or error message:
When calling the eBay API in `orders.py`, the following error now occurs when requesting a new access token:

{'error': 'invalid_client', 'error_description': 'client authentication failed'}

This occurs despite having a valid `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` and `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` set in `.env`, and correct values confirmed.

Fix the client authentication flow in the token request.
Ensure the `Authorization` header is correctly constructed using base64-encoded `client_id:client_secret` as required by eBay OAuth.

Return the full corrected file. No placeholders, no boilerplate.


And here is the file causing the issue:

import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

EBAY_CLIENT_ID = os.getenv("EBAY_CLIENT_ID")
EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv("EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET")
EBAY_REFRESH_TOKEN = os.getenv("EBAY_REFRESH_TOKEN")

def get_access_token():
    url = "https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    }
    data = {
        "grant_type": "refresh_token",
        "refresh_token": EBAY_REFRESH_TOKEN,
        "scope": "https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data, auth=(EBAY_CLIENT_ID, EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET))
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()["access_token"]
    else:
        print("Failed to retrieve access token:", response.json())
        raise Exception("Failed to retrieve access token")

def get_orders_raw():
    token = get_access_token()
    # ... additional code omitted ...


Your task:
- Identify the bug
- Provide the corrected code
- If necessary, add a brief comment above the fix

Return the complete corrected file. No explanation outside the code.

You are helping build a local script to obtain an eBay refresh token using the Authorization Code Grant Flow.

Create a complete working Python script using Flask that:

1. Loads `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`, `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `EBAY_REDIRECT_URI` from a `.env` file.
   - Use `https://localhost:8080/callback` as the expected redirect URI.
   - eBay requires HTTPS for redirect URIs, even for localhost.

2. Starts a local Flask app on `https://localhost:8080` using `ssl_context='adhoc'` (self-signed cert).

3. Defines a `/start` route that redirects the user to eBay's OAuth login page, including:
   - client_id
   - response_type=code
   - redirect_uri
   - scope

4. Defines a `/callback` route to:
   - Capture the returned authorization `code`
   - Exchange the code for `access_token` and `refresh_token` using the correct POST to `https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token`
   - Show both tokens to the user on a success page

5. Updates `.env` safely:
   - If `EBAY_REFRESH_TOKEN` exists, replace it
   - If not present, append it
   - Preserve all other `.env` contents

Use the `sell.fulfillment` scope and return a fully working script with no placeholders.

Flask must run on `https://localhost:8080` with `ssl_context='adhoc'`.

[Response]
Below is a complete Python script that uses Flask to implement the eBay OAuth flow to obtain a refresh token. This script follows all the requirements you've specified, including reading from and updating the `.env` file, and setting up HTTPS for the Flask app.

First, ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:
```bash
pip install flask python-dotenv requests
```

Create a `.env` file with the following content (fill in your actual eBay credentials):
```
EBAY_CLIENT_ID=your_ebay_client_id
EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_ebay_client_secret
EBAY_REDIRECT_URI=https://localhost:8080/callback
```

Here's the complete script:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, url_for
from dotenv import load_dotenv, dotenv_values, set_key
import os
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)
load_dotenv()

EBAY_CLIENT_ID = os.getenv('EBAY_CLIENT_ID')
EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET')
EBAY_REDIRECT_URI = os.getenv('EBAY_REDIRECT_URI')
EBAY_AUTH_URL = "https://auth.ebay.com/oauth2/authorize"
EBAY_TOKEN_URL = "https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token"
SCOPE = "https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.fulfillment"

@app.route('/start')
def start():
    params = {
        'client_id': EBAY_CLIENT_ID,
        'response_type': 'code',
        'redirect_uri': EBAY_REDIRECT_URI,
        'scope': SCOPE
    }
    login_url = requests.Request('GET', EBAY_AUTH_URL, params=params).prepare().url
    return redirect(login_url)

@app.route('/callback')
def callback():
    code = request.args.get('code')
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
        'Authorization': f'Basic {requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(EBAY_CLIENT_ID, EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET).encode()}'
    }
    data = {
        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
        'code': code,
        'redirect_uri': EBAY_REDIRECT_URI
    }
    response = requests.post(EBAY_TOKEN_URL, headers=headers, data=data)
    tokens = response.json()
    access_token = tokens.get('access_token')
    refresh_token = tokens.get('refresh_token')

    # Update .env file with new refresh token
    env_values = dotenv_values()
    env_values['EBAY_REFRESH_TOKEN'] = refresh_token
    with open('.env', 'w') as f:
        for key, value in env_values.items():
            f.write(f'{key}={value}\n')

    return f"Access Token: {access_token}<br>Refresh Token: {refresh_token}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(ssl_context='adhoc', port=8080)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Environment Variables**: The script loads environment variables using `python-dotenv`.
2. **OAuth Flow**: It handles the OAuth flow by redirecting to eBay's login page and then handling the callback to exchange the authorization code for tokens.
3. **HTTPS Configuration**: The Flask app runs with an ad-hoc SSL context to satisfy eBay's requirement for HTTPS even on localhost.
4. **Updating `.env` File**: The script updates the `.env` file with the new refresh token without losing other existing settings.

### Running the Script:
- Start the script.
- Navigate to `https://localhost:8080/start` in your browser to initiate the OAuth flow.
- Log in to eBay and authorize the application.
- The script will display the access and refresh tokens and update the `.env` file accordingly.

Make sure to handle any potential errors in real-world applications, such as checking the response status code from eBay and handling exceptions.
